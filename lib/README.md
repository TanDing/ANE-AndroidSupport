# Android Support ANEs

The following summarises the functionality in each of the ANEs. 
Most are directly related to one ANE however several are shared amongst multiple extensions 
and will be in used in more the future.


## V4

This is the most commonly used ANE. It contains the Support v4 library which is the most 
commonly used component of the Android Support Library and that most of the other support 
libraries rely upon.

It contains a range of backward compatibility utilities that are used in many of our 
(and other providers) extensions.

> **Note**: if you have been using the older `com.distriqt.AndroidSupport.ane` you should remove that
> ANE and replace it with the equivalent `com.distriqt.androidsupport.V4.ane`. This is the new 
> version of this ANE and has been renamed to better identify the ANE with regards to its contents.
